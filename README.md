# WebsiteBlocker

Building a Robust Website Blocker with Python

Developed a robust Website Blocker application using Python, employing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for streamlined organization and modularity. This project leverages platform compatibility, ensuring seamless functionality across various operating systems—Windows, macOS, and Linux—allowing users a versatile experience.

Utilizing Python's platform library, the application dynamically configures the system path for the host file, enabling efficient website blocking based on predefined schedules. The project incorporates an intuitive scheduling framework, enabling users to specify blocking intervals, such as weekdays from 9 AM to 5 PM.

The core functionality includes real-time blocking and unblocking of specified websites, offering users control over their browsing experience. The application logs the actions performed, maintaining a detailed record of blocked websites with timestamps, facilitating effective monitoring and accountability.

By employing Python's datetime module, the project enables precise time-based operations, ensuring accurate execution of blocking schedules. The application's modular structure allows easy modification and addition of websites to the block list, granting users the flexibility to tailor their browsing preferences.

This project serves as an excellent demonstration of Python's versatility and the MVC framework's efficiency, providing a robust solution for managing website access and promoting productive online habits
